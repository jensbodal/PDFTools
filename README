Java package meant to be a standalone PDF reader

Planning to implement additional features as I go along, however this is more of a personal project to practice working on other projects and coding in Java.

Currently I am experimenting with the following libraries:

ICEPdf - 5.0.4
Thumbnailinator - 0.4.7
PDFBox - 1.8.4
PDFView aka PDFRenderer - 0.9.1
